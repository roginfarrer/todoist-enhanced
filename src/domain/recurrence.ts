/**
 * Reading a recurrence out of what somebody typed.
 *
 * This recognises a recurrence. It does not resolve one: no function here ever
 * works out what date "every 3 days" lands on. That is Todoist's job, it is
 * the only place that can get it right across time zones and completions, and
 * the app's part is to hand over the phrase and keep out of the way.
 *
 * Which makes the whole contract a narrow one: find the phrase, say where it
 * sits so the caller can mark and strip it, and say which language it was read
 * in so the right parser is asked for on the other end.
 *
 * The grammar follows the list Todoist publishes, because that list is the
 * contract: a phrase this reads is a phrase their parser has to resolve, and
 * one it invents is a series moved to a date nobody asked for. What is covered:
 *
 *   every day / daily, every N hours|days|weeks|months|quarters|years
 *   every other <unit>, every week|month|quarter|year, quarterly
 *   every <weekday>[, <weekday>...], every weekday|workday|weekend
 *   every <N>th and lists of them — "every 2, 15, 27"
 *   every <month> <N> / every <N> <month>, and lists — "every 14 jan, 14 apr"
 *   every 1st|2nd|last <weekday>, every first|15th|last workday
 *   a time on the end — "at 9am", "at 20:00", "at noon", "à 9h30"
 *   a bound on the end — starting / until / ending / for N weeks
 *   "every!" on any of it
 *
 * Still refused: anything resting on a calendar we do not have (holidays,
 * "the workday after"), and any phrase containing "every" that none of the
 * above matches. A refusal costs a task that keeps its name. A wrong reading
 * costs a series, silently, and shows up weeks later.
 *
 * The phrase goes to Todoist as typed, in the language it was read in, with
 * one exception marked below where French word order has no counterpart in
 * anything Todoist documents and the canonical English form is sent instead.
 *
 * `every` and `every!` differ in where the next occurrence is counted from —
 * the current due date, or the day it was actually completed — which is why an
 * overdue `every! 3 days` jumps to three days from today rather than filling in
 * the ones it missed. Nothing here needs to know that to pass the phrase on,
 * but the caller shows it, so it is reported.
